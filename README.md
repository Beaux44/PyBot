# PyBot
***
PyBot is a Twitch chatbot that I've made in a way so that people can use it so spam your chat, just for some fun. If you don't want massive amounts of spam in your chat, this isn't the bot for you.

I'm currently attempting to create a chat-based programming language for the bot, specifically for the use of spamming. I hope to at one point allow people that watch the stream more, to be able to spam with it more with the use of some sort of points. Something I've had a lot of problems with, adding commands through the chat. And, finally, some sort of minigames system, this is the big goal in this project - to have a fully functioning bot that can do multiple different sorts of games. I'm not sure how long this will take, but I'll get it done eventually.

### So, here's the check list for the project *(I had a slight revelation that my code is more than a little bit messed up, so this will be significantly postponed)*:
